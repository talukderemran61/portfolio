# OverTheWire — Bandit Writeups

This folder contains my personal writeups for the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame.  
Each level explores a new concept in Linux basics, file handling, permissions, networking, and security.

##  How I Document
Each writeup follows a consistent format:
- **Challenge Name / Description**
- **Goal**
- **Tools / Commands Used**
- **Step-by-step Approach**
- **Commands & Outputs**
- **Flag / Result**
- **Screenshots**
- **Lessons Learned / Remediation**
- **References**

##  Notes
- Passwords are included in the writeups since Bandit credentials are public and resettable.  
- The goal is to show **learning process and methodology**, not just the final flag.  
- Screenshots are stored in `assets/bandit/` and linked in each writeup.
