# Bandit - level 1 -> 2
**Challenge name:** spaces in this filename
**Date:** 22 Oct 2025
**Time spent:** ~5 mins
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

## Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `--spaces in this filename--` located in the home directory

---

## Tools / commands you may use
- `ls` , `cd` , `cat` , `file` , `du` , `find`

---

## Approach (step-by-step)
1. **Connect to the server** using the credentials from previous level:
    ```bash
    ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

2. **List files** in the home directory to see the oddly-named file:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    You should see a file named `--spaces in this filename--`.

3.  **Read the file** — because the filename contains spaces, treat the name as a single argument. You can either:
    - wrap the file in quotes:
    ```bash
    cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"
    ```
    - or escape the spaces:
    ```bash
    cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--
    ```
    - or use tab-completion after typing the first word:
    ```bash
    cat ./-<TAB>
    ```

4. **Copy the password** from the output and use it to SSH into the next level (`bandit3`).

bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--

```

---

## Flags / result
- password: `MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx`  
    Use it to login:
```bash
ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

---

## Lesson learned
- Filenames with spaces must be quoted or have their spaces escaped when passed as a single command-line argument.
- Tab-completion is a quick way to avoid quoting/escaping mistakes.
