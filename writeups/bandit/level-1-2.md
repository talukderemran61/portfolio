# Bandit - level 1 -> 2
**Challenge name:** read file starts with special character
**Date:** 22 Oct 2025
**Time spent:** ~5 mins
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

## Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

---

## Tools / commands may be used
- `ls` , `cd` , `cat` , `file` , `du` , `find`

---

## Approach (step-by-step)
1. **Connect to the server** using the credentials from previous level:
    ```bash
    ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

2. **Locate the file in home directory**
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    look for file named **-**

3. **Read the file to retrieve the next level password**
    Usually one would try `cat <filename>` to read a file. But in this case it won't work because the file name is hyphen(-) which is in unix-like system a convention for "standard input" for commands that read from a file or other resources. So, instead of reading the file it starts reading from user input.  
    
    To circumbent this problem one must use the relative or absolute file name to access the file.   
    Use:
    ```bash
    cat ./- or cat ~/-
    ```
    Copy the output and use it to SSH to `bandit2`
