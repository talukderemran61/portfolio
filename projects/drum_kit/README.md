#  Drum Kit Website  

A fun and interactive **drum kit web app** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project is part of **Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp**, where the goal was to practice **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript.  

---

##  Demo
When you open the website, you can:
- **Click** on the drum buttons to play different drum sounds.  
- **Press keys (w, a, s, d, j, k, l)** on your keyboard to play corresponding drum sounds.  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure of the webpage  
- **CSS3** – styling of the drum kit  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – event listeners, sound playback, and animations  

---

##  Project Structure
    drum-kit/
    │── index.html # Main HTML file
    │── styles.css # Styling
    │── index.js # JavaScript logic
    │── images/ # Drum image files
    └── sounds/ # Drum sound files (kick, snare, tom, etc.)

##  Features
- Plays sounds when buttons are clicked or when specific keys are pressed.  
- Adds a temporary **button animation effect** for a more interactive experience.  
- Responsive and simple design with a playful UI.  

---

##  Lessons Learned
- How to use **`addEventListener`** for `click` and `keydown` events.  
- Using **`switch` statements** to map keys to sounds.  
- Adding and removing **CSS classes dynamically** for animations.  
- Understanding how the **DOM** connects HTML, CSS, and JS together.
